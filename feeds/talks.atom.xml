&lt;p&gt;A workshop/tutorial for Python/Django developers who would like to contribute more to the projects they use, but
need more grounding in some of the tools required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop will take participants through the complete cycle of identifying a simple issue in a Django or Python
project, writing a patch with documentation, and submitting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.1 The purpose of the workshop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to commit will help put you in a position to commit successfully to collaborative projects.
You’ll find it particularly useful if you think you have some good coding ideas, but find that managing the development
process sometimes gets in the way of your actual development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you need to know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with the commandline prompt in a terminal.
You’ll need to know how to install software. Some of the examples given refer to Debian/Ubuntu’s apt-get; you
ought to know what the equivalent is on whatever operating system you’re using.
You’ll also need to know how to edit plain text or source files of various kinds.
It will be very useful to have some understanding of Python, but it’s not strictly necessary. However, if you’ve never
done any programming, that will probably be an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial assumes that you’re using a Unix-like system, but there should be no reason why (for example) it would
not work for Windows users. You’ll need a suitable text editor, that you’re comfortable using. Other software will be used, but the tutorial will discuss its installation.
However, your environment does need to be set up appropriately, and you will need to know how to use it effectively. If your system already has Django and/or Python packages running that you’ve installed, you probably already have
what you need and know what you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;python2.7 or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git&lt;/li&gt;
