&lt;p&gt;A workshop/tutorial for Python/Django developers who would like to contribute more to the projects they use, but
need more grounding in some of the tools required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop will take participants through the complete cycle of identifying a simple issue in a Django or Python
project, writing a patch with documentation, and submitting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.1 The purpose of the workshop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to commit will help put you in a position to commit successfully to collaborative projects.
You’ll find it particularly useful if you think you have some good coding ideas, but find that managing the development
process sometimes gets in the way of your actual development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you need to know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with the commandline prompt in a terminal.
You’ll need to know how to install software. Some of the examples given refer to Debian/Ubuntu’s apt-get; you
ought to know what the equivalent is on whatever operating system you’re using.
You’ll also need to know how to edit plain text or source files of various kinds.
It will be very useful to have some understanding of Python, but it’s not strictly necessary. However, if you’ve never
done any programming, that will probably be an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial assumes that you’re using a Unix-like system, but there should be no reason why (for example) it would
not work for Windows users. You’ll need a suitable text editor, that you’re comfortable using. Other software will be used, but the tutorial will discuss its installation.
However, your environment does need to be set up appropriately, and you will need to know how to use it effectively. If your system already has Django and/or Python packages running that you’ve installed, you probably already have
what you need and know what you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe currently has a very high literacy rate of over 90%, despite a very high literacy rate of 90%. While other countries are looking for skilled workers, the opposite is true for Zimbabwe, which has millions of skilled workers looking for employment. Fortunately, the Internet has turned the world into a global village, yes, everyone is talking about globalization! In my talk, I intend to share on the avenues of freelancing and remote working as possible employment/business opportunity for the ordinary, unemployed person in Zimbabwe. I will share on the benefits of both to the developer as well as the nation. I will also share on how to get started as a freelancer or remote worker, with the aim of presenting new and possible employment/entrepreneurship avenues for fellow developers in Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Git"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="snippets"></category></entry><entry><title>Stocktaking, harnessing code in businesss</title><link href="/Stocktaking,%20harnessing%20code%20in%20businesss.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-25T08:00:00+02:00</published><author><name>Charles Katuri</name></author><id>tag:,2016-02-25:Stocktaking, harnessing code in businesss.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Taking a new look at how a Stock Take can be conducted, with more accuracy, efficiency and speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="nodejs"></category><category term="code"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="bitbucket"></category><category term="snippets"></category></entry><entry><title>Automate!</title><link href="/automate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-25T08:00:00+02:00</published><author><name>Shingirayi Mandebvu</name></author><id>tag:,2016-02-25:automate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief talk on the power of python in the workplace. From automating routine tasks,demos of scripts I've written to cut down on time taken.

&lt;p&gt;Basically, it was almost rewritten. Some dependencies from the old version are dead. &lt;a href="https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig"&gt;Swig&lt;/a&gt; is officialy dead, and AngularJS, well, it's not dead, but it's migrating to Angular 2, so it was more easy to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new version some anoying bugs were fixed. You can read more about &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/gistfy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got a little bit easy when you need to share your code. Now, you just need to paste the full url of your GitHub or Bitbucket repository. For example &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/gistfy/blob/master/src/gistfy.js" target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/gistfy/blob/master/src/gistfy.js&lt;/a&gt;, this url you can grab from your browser address bar. Give it a try, click in the link to open on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always use &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/gistfy"&gt;Gistfy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.gistfy.com"&gt;gistfy.com&lt;/a&gt;, but if you want to host your own version it got easy to deploy it on &lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/8/7/heroku-button"&gt;Heroku Button&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/gistfy"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deploy" src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last and not the least, now you have more syle options. You can check it &lt;a href="https://www.gistfy.com/examples.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The new ones are Android Studio, Arduino, CodePen, Visual Studio and Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startups are exciting. But choosing the right tech-stack can be a daunting task: You want to be able to move quickly right from the start, but also remain flexible as the technical requirements inevitably change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will describe my own experience of building out the tech stack for a mobile e-commerce startup. It will cover: • an overview of the main design challenges • the chosen architecture (database, server-side application layer, API and mobile client) • how I used Flask to build the API • how I used Flask-Admin to build a management console • deploying the backend application using docker-compose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same talk that I gave at PyconZA.

&lt;p&gt;In the world of technology we often tend to focus on the technical aspects of software products. However we tend to neglect the main component that determines whether a software application / artifact is a success or failure: the user. Within this talk I will be going through three (3) commands that I live by when working on software projects and they all revolve around principles of USER CENTERED DESIGN. This talk is aimed at everyone from beginners to Experts.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Git"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="snippets"></category></entry><entry><title>Kivy: From Zero to Android</title><link href="/zero-to-android.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-25T08:00:00+02:00</published><author><name>Tatenda Tambo</name></author><id>tag:,2016-02-25:zero-to-android.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would also demonstrate how to test and debug the code on a live Android device and create an apk using Buildozer, with some special attention accorded to including assets (specifically images and custom fonts) when packaging the application. Whilst I do not think this would be a process attendees could do themselves due to the amount of time it takes to initially set up Buildozer, they'll leave confident that they can turn their beautiful code into even more amazing real-world solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Git"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="snippets"></category></entry><entry><title>From Zero to Ninja - how to master software development with Python</title><link href="/zero-to-ninja.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-25T08:00:00+02:00</published><author><name>Petrus Janse van Rensburg</name></author><id>tag:,2016-02-25:zero-to-ninja.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is fun. But becoming a great software developer can be a long, hard and intimidating process without the right support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I want to highlight some of the best resources that I have found for learning to code and then mastering specific topics. The aim is for everyone to walk away with a better understanding of where to start and how to keep going when it comes to planning a career in software development.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Git"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="snippets"></category></entry></feed>
