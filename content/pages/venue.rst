Arrival
=======

By Train
--------

Rapperswil is a 40 minutes train ride from Zürich main station. HSR is *very*
close to Rapperswil train station. If you follow the right exit you end up
right on campus.

For this reason we recommend the use of public transport. It's the easiest
and possibly cheapest option.

By Car
------

Parking is available at HSR for the whole day. The rates are rather pricey
though, so be warned. You do not get any discounts or free parking by
attending the conference.

There are many other parking possibilities in the area though. You can find more
information `in this PDF </files/parking.pdf>`__. The best option is probably
next to the zoo (called "Südquartier, Lido", number 7 on the map).

Registration Desk
=================

The registration desk will be situated at the cafeteria in building 1. This is
also where we will have the breaks in between sessions.

Auditorium
==========

The talks are held at an auditorium (room number 3.008) fitting up to 125 people.
We will make sure that there is ample information on how to get there from the
registration desk by putting up signs on the day of the conference.

Each seat has one electrical plug. Note that if you do not have a Swiss plug
(`SEV 1011 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Swiss_SEV_1011>`_),
you will probably need an adapter. See
`"Do I need a specific power adapter when travelling in Switzerland?"
<https://www.quora.com/Switzerland/Do-I-need-a-specific-power-adapter-when-travelling-in-Switzerland-or-can-an-EU-adapter-be-used-with-Swiss-power-outlets>`_.

Free WiFi is available.

Accessibility
=============

The venue is fully accessible by wheelchair.

Talk Hardware
=============

If you are having a talk at the summit you can expect the following hardware:

* You'll get a wireless headset for recording and amplification.
* We have video adapters for you (but do bring your own just in case).
* Your presentation will be shown with a resolution of 1920x1200 (16:10).

If you plan to have output audio of any kind, do let us know beforehand as we
have to integrate that into our recording.

Job Board
=========

We are going to have a wall with open jobs. If you want to advertise an open
position do print information about it on an A4 page (in portrait orientation)
and we'll hang it up on the wall.

We will also have some empty pages available for ad-hoc job postings.
