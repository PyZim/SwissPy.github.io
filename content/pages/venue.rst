Arrival
=======

By Train
--------

Rapperswil is a 40 minutes train ride from ZÃ¼rich main station. HSR is *very*
close to Rapperswil train station. If you follow the right exit you end up
right on campus.

For this reason we recommend the use of public transport. It's the easiest
and possibly cheapest option.

By Car
------

Parking is available at HSR for the whole day. The rates are rather pricey
though, so be warned. You do not get any discounts or free parking by
attending the conference.

Auditorium
==========

The talks are held at an auditorium fitting up to 125 people. We will make
sure that there is ample information on how to get there from the general
entrance by putting up signs on the day of the conference.
