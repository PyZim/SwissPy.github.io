A Python Conference in Switzerland
==================================

The first Swiss Python conference will take place on **February 5th, 2016** at
**HSR University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil**.

This summit is all about the programming language you love! 
Discover the wide field of Python applications, hear how others use the snake
and meet Swiss Pythonistas. The conference is suited for all skill levels, 
from early beginners to expert developers.

History
=======

After the nice experience of EuroPython 2015, a small group of enthusiasts came
up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference.

As with software development, we think it's a good idea to start with something
simple to prove that it can be done, a minimal viable product. We try to keep
the costs and the organizational effort very low:

* It will be a one day event
* The venue is free / sponsored
* Entry fee will be very low or even free, collection of fees will happen at the venue itself
* Lunch will be paid by attendees themselves
* At this time, we cannot offer speakers or helpers any compensation

Program
=======

We are still calling for proposals until the end of November. Please do propose
your talk now to receive geek cred and bragging rights in the future:

`Propose Your Talk <http://www.python-summit.ch/pages/call-for-proposals.html>`_

The final program will be published in December.
