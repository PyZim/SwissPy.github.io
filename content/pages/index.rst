History
=======

After the nice experience of EuroPython 2015, a small group of enthusiasts came
up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference.

As with software development, we think it's a good idea to start with something
simple to prove that it can be done, a minimal viable product. We try to keep
the costs and the organizational effort very low:

* It will be a one day event
* The venue is free / sponsored
* Entry fee will be very low or even free, collection of fees will happen at the venue itself
* Lunch will be paid by attendees themselves
* At this time, we cannot offer speakers or helpers any compensation

How to collaborate
==================

Have a look at the issue tracker, join the discussion and assign something to
yourself https://github.com/SwissPy/swisspycon/issues.
