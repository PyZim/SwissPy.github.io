The First Swiss Python Summit is Over!
======================================

The conference was a big success. We had 9 great talks and got a lot of
positive feedback from the 114 attendees and speakers.

We'd like to thank all people that helped at the conference or presented a talk.
Without you, the first Swiss Python conference would not have been possible!

Thanks also to the `HSR <https://www.hsr.ch/>`__ that hosted us as well as our
sponsors `Divio <https://www.divio.com/>`__, `Beekeeper
<http://beekeeper.ch/de/>`__, `Seantis <https://seantis.ch/>`__ and `Webrepublic
<https://webrepublic.com/>`__.

If you're interested in making another edition of the conference happen and
would like to help, please contact us at `info@python-summit.ch
<mailto:info@python-summit.ch>`__.

We will publish the recorded talks and the corresponding slides `here
</pages/recordings.html>`__ in the next few weeks. Stay tuned!


A Python Conference in Switzerland
==================================

The first Swiss Python conference will take place on **February 5th, 2016** at
**HSR University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil**.

This summit is all about the programming language you love!
Discover the wide field of Python applications, hear how others use the snake
and meet Swiss Pythonistas. The conference is suited for all skill levels,

History
=======

After the nice experience of EuroPython 2015, a small group of enthusiasts came
up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference.

As with software development, we think it's a good idea to start with something
simple to prove that it can be done, a minimal viable product. We try to keep
the costs and the organizational effort very low:

* It will be a one day event
* The venue is free / sponsored
* The entry fee will only be 10 CHF - this will be collected at registration
* Lunch will be paid by attendees themselves
* At this time, we cannot offer speakers or helpers any compensation

Program
=======

The program has been published `here </pages/program.html>`__.
