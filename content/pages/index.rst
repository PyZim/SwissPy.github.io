History
=======

After the nice experience of Europython 2015 a small group of enthusiasts came up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference.

As with software development, we think is a good idea to start with something simple to proof that it can be done, a minimal viable product.

We can keep the costs down to zero if we manage to do the following:

* Find a free venue
* Not offer any food, but give the option to either reserve enough places in a restaurant or sign up for food delivery, which would be privately paid by each attendant.
* Make it a one day event, to reduce the complexity of the logistics and to spare the participants the need of lodging 

How to collaborate
==================

Have a look at the issue tracker, join the discussion and assign something to yourself https://github.com/SwissPy/swisspycon/issues.
