We'd love to see you at the summit!
===================================

To join us at the conference, you need **10 CHF** (unless you are a student at HSR).
This money will be used for promotion, drinks and snacks. Lunch is *not* included.

We are strictly non-profit. All extra proceeds are split between the Python Software Foundation and the Django Girls Foundation.
You pay the money directly on site on the day of the conference.

Note, the number of attendants is **limited to 120 people**, so reserve your spot now:
