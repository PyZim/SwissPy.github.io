:summary: Call for Helpers

We need your help!
==================

The conference is approaching, and we still need a lot of helpers! If you wish
to help, especially if you already signed up, please contact us at
**info@python-summit.ch**.

We need helpers in the following areas. If you contact us, please let us know
which areas would interest you. We'll then try to come up with a schedule that
suits everybody.

The conference is already booked out, but if you haven't registered yet, we can
try to get you on the list anyways, but can't guarantee it anymore at this
point. As we're a non-profit conference and need the entrance fee of 10 CHF to
cover running costs, unfortuantely you will still have to pay the entrance fee
(except if you're HSR student). You will get a free staff t-shirt though!

Registration desk (08:15-09:45)
-------------------------------

Welcome the people, verify their registration, collect entrance fee,
hand out lanyards.

3 helpers needed

Catering
--------

Handing out coffee and snacks.

We need 1 responsible person and 3 helpers during each of the
following blocks:

- Registration (08:15-09:45)
- Morning break (10:20-11:10)
- Afternoon break (15:00-15:50)

It would be ideal if the person that takes the lead (mainly coordinating the
other helpers) could do that during all three blocks, but it would also be
possible to do it for only one or two blocks.

Hand out microphones
--------------------

After the talks there will be Q&A sessions. For that, 2 people will need to hand
out the mics to the people in the audience that have questions.

We need 2 people for each of the following blocks:

- Morning (09:00-10:30 and 11:00-12:20)
- Afternoon (13:40-15:10 and 15:40-17:20)

Talk manager
------------

We need people to introduce the speakers and their talks. You will also be
responsible to brief the speakers about their talk and about their available
time. If necessary, signal to them that their time is up.

- Morning (09:00-10:30 and 11:00-12:20)
- Afternoon (13:40-15:10 and 15:40-17:20)

Audio recording
---------------

We need a person responsible for the audio recordings.

Video recording
---------------

We need a person responsible for the video recordings.

Video postprocessing
--------------------

We need someone that can postprocess the videos:

- Cut them
- Add our logo

Live Tweeting
-------------

We could use a social media affine person that could do some live tweeting about
the conference using our official Twitter account (@pythonsummit).

Catering during Social Event

There will be a social event with beer and snacks after the conference.  We need
people for catering and cleaning up afterwards. Start is at 17:20.
