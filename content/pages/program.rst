Program
=======

It's been a difficult task to create a program, considering we received 40
proposals and time only allows for a maximum of 9 slots. Many promising
proposals had to be left out to our regret, but we are certain that we managed
to put together an amazing and very diverse program!

                    <p class="description">Have you ever been really annoyed
                    about some APIs of open source libraries? There's are good
                    reasons to be. Most libraries are devoted to backwards
                    compatibility and are not able to change content anymore.
                    <br>
                    Coming from writing a Python library called "Jedi", I can
                    feel with you. I have hated my own APIs more than enough. I
                    have learned the hard way and want to tell you a few things
                    I would have loved to hear years earlier!
                    <br>
                    <strong>Designing Python APIs</strong>
                    <br>
                    Quite a few common pitfalls exist in API design in Python.
                    To name a few: Overuse of properties, classes that should be
                    functions, javaisms and a lot of other issues. Learn to see
                    the difference between good & bad.
                    <br>
                    There's a lot to learn from our external APIs for our
                    internal APIs or in general software architecture. Bad
                    internal APIs lead to code smells. You will learn how to
                    detect code smell that points to bad APIs.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Dicussing well-known libraries</strong>
                    <br>
                    We will analyze well known libraries like requests,
                    BeautifulSoup, Django and more. I will tell you what they
                    did well and where they struggle. Some libraries have with
                    immense capabilities have not been used very much, because
                    their APIs are too complicated. We will also be talking
                    about how Amazon won the cloud storage game, the way Docker
                    wins everything else and why some other awesome tools don't
                    seem to get very far!

                    <p class="description">I will introduce CFFI, a way to call
                    C libraries from Python. It was designed in 2012 to get away
                    from Python's C extension modules, which require
                    hand-written CPython-specific C code. CFFI is arguably
                    simpler to use: you call C from Python directly, instead of
                    going through an intermediate layer. It is not tied to
                    CPython's internals, and works natively on two different
                    Python implementations: CPython and PyPy. (It is also a big
                    success, according to the download statistics.)
                    <br>
                    PyPy is an alternative Python implementation, which is
                    highly compatible with CPython but rewritten from
                    scratch – in Python. It is much faster than the standard
                    CPython on long-running tasks thanks to its Just-in-Time
                    compiler. I will talk about it during the later part of the
                    talk.</p>

                    ways of "augmenting" acoustical musical instruments with new
                    possibilities offered by computers. For doing so, we need
                    ultra-low latency real-time audio processing programs.
                    Pretty much the typical situation where python should *not*
                    be used, right?  Wrong. We've recently included python (with
                    a strong use of Olivier Bélanger's wonderful pyo module) in
                    our set of tools for realizing the musical ideas we have in
                    mind. This talk will expose why we came to consider python
                    as a very interesting option for our realtime audio systems
                    and how we use it on stage, with code and sound samples.</p>

                    <p class="description">Scrapy is a versatile tool to scrape
                    web pages with Python. Thanks to its pipeline architecture,
                    it is easy to add new consumers to work on the scraped data.
                    One such pipeline allows us to index the scraped data with
                    Elasticsearch. With Elasticsearch, we can make the scraped
                    data searchable in a highly efficient way. In this talk, we
                    will not only show you the basics of the interaction between
                    Scrapy and Elasticsearch, but also a hands-on showcase where
                    we use these tools to collect sport results of Swiss running

Aperitif 
========

Right after the conference we'll have a small aperitif at HSR's cafeteria,
sponsored by `Beekeeper <http://beekeeper.ch/>`_. There will be soft drinks,
water, beer and sandwiches free of charge for all conference attendees.

Key Signing Event
=================

During the aperitif we'll also have a key signing party for anyone wanting to
expand the web of trust with additional signatures. This is how it will be
conducted:

To participate print out your fingerprint before the conference using
`<http://keysheet.net>`_ for instance and be sure to have a suitable form of
identification with you (typically a national ID card, passport or a
drivers-license).

During the aperitif we will put up a poster, where anyone interested in
getting more signatures can gather around. Typically you will get the
fingerprint printout from the other person and give them yours. You then you
check the other person's id and then make a note on the fingerprint slip
that you have verified it. At the end of the event you should have a collection
of these to process at home.

After the event you download the keys of a keyserver, verify the fingerprints
you have collected and sign each of the keys. Now you can upload the signature,
or if the other party requested it, return it to them via encrypted mail
(see `<https://wiki.debian.org/caff>`_ for automating this).

For more info see `<https://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning>`_ and the documents
linked off that page.
